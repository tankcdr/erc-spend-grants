# Changelog

What changed in the ERC-8427 draft, its reference implementation, and the Arc testnet deployment, newest first. Dates are commit dates. An entry marked **interface** changes the registry ABI, the typed data, or `consume` behavior; grants signed against an earlier registry do not carry over, because a new registry is a new signing domain.

The draft is [`ERCS/erc-8427.md`](ERCS/erc-8427.md), under review in [ethereum/ERCs#2037](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/2037). Discussion is on the [Magicians thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8427-portable-spend-grants/29776).

## 2026-10-06

Two parts: text corrections, then one interface addition and two reference decisions made ahead of the next deployment.

### Specification

- **interface** `hashGrant(grant)` returns the hash the registry computes for a grant. Wallets revoke that value rather than one they computed, because `revoke` cannot tell a wrong hash from a right one.

### Reference

- The deploy script binds the registry to `SpendGrantAuthorizationExecutor`, which accepts direct calls and relayed delegate-signed authorizations. A registry fixes its executor for good, so the relayed path has to be chosen at deployment.
- The authorization's EIP-712 domain name is `SpendAuthorization`, version `1`, no longer the contract's name. `vectors/authorization-v1.json` is regenerated.

### Corrections (no interface change)

### Specification

- Canonical rendering: the byte-exact rule applies to a plain-text presentation of a grant's complete terms in raw signed values. A display that converts units, dates, or names, summarizes, or shows only some terms is a formatted display whatever its medium.
- Revocation: wallets keep `grantSignature` with the grant. The confirmation step is restated so it can be carried out: check the stored signature against the computed hash, revoke, then read `revoked`; or simulate `consume` with the signature, the delegate as authorizer, and a time inside validity.
- Delegation framework: the hook and redeemer-record mechanics are stated as conditions of a framework rather than as properties of ERC-7710. Every requirement on the enforcer and executor is unchanged, and any other source of the redeemer must give the same properties.
- Rationale: expired debits are dropped by `consume` or `evict`; the payee rule names the spent asset and why.
- Replacing a grant: terms cannot be changed in place in either direction. A replacement is released to the delegate only after the earlier grant reads as revoked; wallets show the change as incomplete until then; a replacement starts with fresh usage, so its lifetime cap is sized from what the earlier grant had left and the window reset is disclosed or avoided with `validAfter`. Raised on the thread. `test/SpendGrantReplacement.t.sol` pins the behavior the text relies on.
- Security Considerations: a principal without gas can stop every grant over a permit-capable token with a signed zero approval; disabling a delegation is not a revocation; a signer that signs raw digests sees no domain, so domain-scoped session-key policies need a format that carries the typed data.

## 2026-10-05

Three rounds in one day: two reviewers' points from the thread, a logic review of the whole draft, and an audit pass over the reference (nine checklist domains, Slither, fuzzing, Halmos). One High was found and fixed.

### Specification

- **interface** `consume` rejects a payee of zero, the principal, the registry, the executor, or the asset being spent, in both recipient modes.
- **interface** Code is checked only on the asset being spent, after the asset is matched, and an EIP-7702 delegated account is not a token.
- **interface** `GrantConsumed` indexes `grantHash`, `principal`, and `recipient`; `asset` and `amount` are data.
- **interface** `evict(grantHash, asset, maxCount)` lets anyone drop expired debits in bounded pieces.
- Caps bound the amount the executor requests, which must equal the amount passed to `consume`. Token fees and rebases are the asset's behavior. A balance check is optional and may only revert.
- Delegation framework mechanism rewritten around the two shapes a redemption takes. The record path is confined to the principal's own account: the enforcer writes a record only for the principal's delegation, clears what is not taken, and the executor accepts no other caller on that path. This closes the High: a middle delegator riding the delegate's redemption for extra spends.
- Grants never supersede one another; wallets should revoke the old hash when replacing a grant and show per-delegate totals.
- A contract principal's ERC-1271 policy is its grant-signing policy. The ERC-1271 call must be a `STATICCALL`.
- `consume` and the movement happen within one call to the executor.
- Signed authorizations: EIP-712 over their own message, nonce checked before the signature, and invalidation fails for a nonce that already ran.
- Spendable-now is bounded by free debit slots. Added notes on relayer gas exposure, rollup clock bounds, Arc's USDC as the gas balance, and not redeploying at an old address on a reset chain.

### Reference

- `SpendGrantAuthorizationExecutor`: delegate-signed authorizations submitted by anyone.
- `SpendGrantRedemptionEnforcer` and `SpendGrantRedemptionExecutor`: the ERC-7710 path, tested against a mock manager and against MetaMask's DelegationManager v1.3.0 on Arc (`pnpm test:fork`).
- `SpendGrantSignature`: the Signatures rules, shared by the registry and executors. Low-level calls copy at most one word of return data.
- `vectors/authorization-v1.json`: a viem-generated vector for the authorization digest, checked in TypeScript and Solidity.
- `evm_version` pinned to `cancun`.

### Deployment (Arc testnet, 5042002)

- Registry `0x37ceecB34B97B39D5B07e8D7Dd974A5a9aD14425`, executor `0x08493Be1675070c2069a719A850f2F9d4624177E`. Current.
- Superseded the same day: registry `0x867C295d38dF1E0d6069bC0b10d1A3148C7E17d5`, executor `0x8074A7bCb5c26AD9d90E7cAC91aCF3809c40BFfd`.

## 2026-09-28

### Specification

- Number assigned: ERC-8427.
- **interface** `consume` takes `authorizer`. Executors must authenticate who authorized each spend; holding a grant and its signature is not authority. New reason `UNAUTHORIZED_DELEGATE`. Raised on the thread by zexoverz.
- **interface** `liveDebits(grantHash, asset, maxCount)` returns each unexpired debit's expiry and amount, so wallets can show what is spendable now and when more frees up. Raised on the thread by Anzus_GemWallet.
- Movement must come from the principal's own balance.
- Stated assumptions an implementer or wallet could miss: grants are public and linkable, revocation is front-runnable and needs the grant, the registry fixes the executor's address and not its code.

### Deployment (Arc testnet, 5042002)

- Superseded: registry `0xf22647d93a960db3629cAEd6D75AdC688A6947B4`, executor `0x45708e14e1B19B43cBaB9a90D4374C6bEd4a70Dd`.
- Superseded: registry `0xA4B1Cf19bE43f8c4879e779e82b6Eee026e925f1`, executor `0x2e5386E8b9c43b2c90Cd59b257e89085bA28AcD5`.

## 2026-09-25

### Specification

- First public draft, posted to Ethereum Magicians and opened as ethereum/ERCs#2037.
- `renderingHash` dropped from the signed grant; the rendering is a function of the signed fields.
- `assetCombine` reserved at `0`; a shared budget across assets is left to a later version.

### Reference

- Registry with an exact rolling window in a 1024-slot ring, minimal executor, TypeScript hashing, rendering, and strict JSON parsing, golden vectors, Halmos properties, and an ERC-7730 descriptor.

### Deployment (Arc testnet, 5042002)

- Superseded: registry `0xE3591E35c6473FB2A9D2f7370d1FE3454864fb32`, executor `0xd0F9e902b054fd8B329Ae8615F9C8247A199ecd2`.
